Solar-Angle-Calculator
======================

Calculate Azimuth and Zenith for complete day to day analysis.

Darren Cattle 11/24/2014

This will calculate solar azimuth and zenith over a day.

Output will go into a table format.

Only required definitions are day of year and latitude.

Code is written in MatLab for purpose, but can be converted to any coding language. I intend to eventually make a javascript page for usage, most of the scripts out there for this purpose are not clean or do not give you accurate data. Any suggestions on differing formulae or practical results are open for discussion.

Formulas are derived from the book: Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes

Credit to Cooper (1970) and Spencer (1971) for formulas.
